Python Program – Student Marks & List Operations

This project contains a simple Python script that demonstrates:

Student Marks Lookup – using a dictionary and case-insensitive name search.

List Operations – extracting and reversing elements from a list.

1. Student Marks Lookup

The program stores marks of students in a dictionary.

User is asked to enter a student’s name.

If the name exists → prints the marks.

If not → prints "Student not found".


2. List Operations

Creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10.

Extracts the first 5 elements.

Reverses the extracted sub-list.
